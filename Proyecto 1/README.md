# Proyecto 1 - IC4302 Bases de Datos II

## Introduction
Following is the documentation for 'Proyecto 1' of the course IC4302 - Databases II.
This project assignment focuses on developing an application that integrates multiple technologies, including MariaDB, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, and the Hugging Face API. The application is designed to handle various tasks such as loading and processing datasets, generating text embeddings, and interacting with these databases. To optimize performance, the system includes caching using Memcached, and it is instrumented with Prometheus to monitor critical metrics such as HTTP request counts, query response times, object processing times, and cache efficiency.

The application is deployed in a Kubernetes environment using Helm Charts, ensuring scalability, manageability, and observability. Each component is containerized using Docker, packaging only the necessary dependencies and database interactions. For performance evaluation, the system collects Prometheus metrics and displays them on Grafana dashboards, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of the system's performance under different workloads.

Additionally, a React-based UI is implemented, allowing users to interact with the system in a user-friendly way. The UI supports functionality such as user registration and login, submitting prompts to query songs using vector search on Elasticsearch, and interacting with friends through a social feed. Users can search for song-related prompts, follow friends, and manage their profiles and posts. The UI is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment and exposed via NodePort for external access. The UI interacts with the backend API to perform various tasks, such as querying the database, processing text, and caching results.

# How to Test

To test the whole project together, you can follow the next steps:
First you need to do the build and install steps, in this time you have to choose the components that will be used for this you have to change in TC1\charts\app\values.yaml, after that to verify that the project is working correctly you can follow the next steps:

- Check Docker images are running, you can check this in the Docker Desktop application. In this area it is important to check the different images, you can check the logs of the images to see if there are any errors. You should check the logs of the S3 Crawler, Backend API, Hugging Face API, Ingest, the MariaDB, Memcached, Prometheus, and Grafana images. You can check the logs of the images by clicking on the image and then clicking on the logs button. Y


- After that you can check in Lens that the pods are running correctly, here you can check the logs of the pods to see if there are any errors and the status of the pods.


- Once you have checked all the logs and the data is being processed correctly, you can consider to go to Grafana to see the metrics of the project. To do this you should forward the port of the Grafana service called **grafana-deployment** to you local machine. From here you can access the Grafana dashboards by going to http://localhost: (Port you decide) and logging in with the credentials **admin** and the password found in the GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD variable which can be found while observing the logs of the Grafana pod.


- Once you enter Grafana, you can see various dashboards displaying metrics for different components of the project. The databases being monitored include MariaDB, Elasticsearch, and Memcached, all of which are critical to the system's performance. These metrics provide insights into the behavior and efficiency of the databases and caching systems. Additionally, each of the Python components, such as the Hugging Face API, S3 Crawler, Backend API and Ingest service, have dedicated dashboards that track their respective metrics. These include the number of requests, object processing times, and error rates, providing full visibility into how each part of the system is functioning. This allows for thorough monitoring of all the critical processes in real time. These metrics are made possible by Prometheus, which continuously scrapes data from the components, stores it in its internal database, and then feeds this information to Grafana for visualization. Monitoring is a crucial part of this project, as it helps identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization, offering a real-time overview of the system's performance.

- The frontend is also available for testing, you can access it by forwarding the port of the frontend service called **frontend-deployment** to your local machine. From here you can access the frontend by going to http://localhost: (Port you decide) and interact with the UI. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system, including features such as user registration, login, and social feed. Users can submit prompts to query songs using vector search on Elasticsearch, follow friends, and manage their profiles and posts. The frontend interacts with the backend API to perform various tasks, such as querying the database, processing text, and caching results.

# Components

## Databases:

The databases used in the project are MariaDB and ElasticSearch. These databases are widely used in the industry and offer features for storing and managing data. 

MariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system that is compatible with MySQL. It provides excellent performance, scalability, and reliability. MariaDB ensures data integrity and consistency. It also offers advanced features such as replication, clustering, and high availability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data.

Elasticsearch is also a popular NoSQL database that is used for full-text search and analytics. It is designed for real-time search and analysis of large volumes of data. It offers features like full-text search, aggregations, and spatial search, making it suitable for handling complex data structures and performing advanced queries.

MariaDB is well-suited for handling complex data structures and performing complex queries. They offer strong data consistency, reliability, and security. The choice between the two databases depends on specific project requirements, familiarity with the technology, and the need for specific features or compatibility with existing systems. On the other hand, Elasticsearch is ideal for full-text search and analytics, providing fast and scalable search capabilities for large volumes of data.

Overall, the combination of MariaDB and ElasticSearch in this project ensures efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval, enabling the application to handle large amounts of data effectively.

The structure of the databases is designed to store data related to songs, users, and objects. The MariaDB database stores user information and object data, while the Elasticsearch database stores song titles, artists, and lyrics. 

MariaDB has the following tables:

- **processed_objects**: Stores information about processed objects, including the `object_key` and the `processed` status.
- **users**: Contains user-related information such as `user_id`, `name`, `username`, `password`, `friends`, `email`, `biography`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- **friends**: Manages friendships between users, storing `friend_id`, `user_id`, `friend_user_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- **prompts**: Holds data about user prompts, including `prompt_id`, `user_id`, `likes`, `prompt`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- **likes**: Keeps track of likes on prompts, storing `like_id`, `user_id`, `prompt_id`, and `created_at`.


## Data Loading Scripts:

As mentioned before, Elasticsearch and MariaDB are populated with certain data each. Elasticsearch is populated with songs and MariaDB is populated with Users and Objects data. The data inserting scripts are written in Python and use the Elasticsearch and MariaDB Python libraries to interact with the databases. Elasticsearch is populated with song data, which includes song titles, artists, and lyrics, allowing for efficient retrieval and search capabilities. In contrast, MariaDB is populated with user and object data, such as login information, user profiles, and object details.The scripts encharge of loading the data into the databases are optimized to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring data integrity throughout the loading process. The scripts help assure that both databases are populated with the necessary data for the application to function correctly.

## S3 Crawler: 

## Hugging Face API: (MODIFY)

The API developed in Flask allows users to access Formula 1 data stored in MariaDB databases. Routes are built that execute SQL queries on various tables related to races, drivers, teams, circuits, and Formula 1 events. The main routes include:

1. Routes for obtaining drivers and constructors:

/drivers: Returns a list of all drivers.
/constructors: Returns a list of all constructors.

2. Routes for obtaining laps and times:

/circuit/<int:id>/laps: Provides the laps recorded at a specific circuit.
/drivers/<int:id>/laps: Provides the laps completed by a driver in all races.

3. Other routes:

/driver/<int:id>/total_races: Returns the total number of races a specific driver has participated in.
/driver/<int:id>/pitstops: Details the pit stops of a driver in different races.

## Ingest:

The Ingest application is a Python component responsible for processing data from RabbitMQ messages. When it receives a message, it first checks MariaDB to see if the object has been previously processed; if so, the message is ignored. If the object is new, it downloads the data from an S3 bucket and processes it as a CSV file. For each row in the CSV, an embedding for the “lyrics” field is generated using the Hugging Face API and added to each row as a new field named “embeddings,” formatted as a dense vector for Elasticsearch. The document, including the embeddings, is then added to Elasticsearch in the index named “songs,” and MariaDB is updated to indicate that the object has been processed. This application runs as a Kubernetes deployment and all necessary configurations are injected as environment variables. Additionally, it exposes various metrics for Prometheus monitoring, including the maximum, minimum, and average processing times for both objects and rows, as well as the total number of objects and rows processed, and the number of rows with errors.The ingest is a critical component of the project, as it processes incoming data from RabbitMQ messages, generates embeddings for the lyrics field using the Hugging Face API, and updates the data in both Elasticsearch and MariaDB. The ingest ensures that new data is processed efficiently and accurately, enabling users to search and retrieve song data effectively. 

## Backend API:

## UI:



## Prometheus:

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting software that is used to collect and store metrics from various components of the project. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the different components, such as databases, API, cache systems, and monitoring tools, and stores them in a time-series database. It provides a specific query language, called PromQL, to retrieve and analyze metrics, enabling users to monitor the performance and health of the system. Prometheus offers features like service discovery, multi-dimensional data model, and powerful queries, making it suitable for monitoring complex environments. In this case Prometheus is used to monitor the different components of the project and store the metrics in its database. It is configured to scrape the metrics with the goal of visualizing them in Grafana. It is configured with automatic service discovery due to the use of technologies like MariaDB which for example count with an integrated exporter that allows Prometheus to scrape the metrics of the databases automatically. In the route TC1/charts/databases/values.yaml you can see the configuration of the databases to be scraped by Prometheus. The servicemonitor resource is used to configure the scraping of the metrics of the different components of the project. As this is enabled in the Helm chart, Prometheus will automatically scrape the metrics of the different components of the project.

## Grafana:

Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform that is used to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. Grafana provides a user-friendly interface to create dashboards and panels that display the metrics in a visually appealing way. It offers a wide range of visualization options, such as graphs, tables, and gauges, allowing users to customize the dashboards according to their needs. Grafana supports various data sources but basis in Prometheus. In this project, Grafana is used to create dashboards that display the metrics of the different components, such as databases, API and  cache systems. The dashboards provide insights into the performance and health of the system, allowing users to identify bottlenecks, anomalies, or areas for optimization. Grafana is configured to connect to Prometheus as a data source, enabling it to retrieve the metrics stored in the Prometheus database and visualize them in the dashboards. The dashboards are designed to display key performance indicators, such as HTTP request counts, query response times, cache efficiency, and resource usage, helping users monitor the system in real time and make informed decisions based on the data.

In this project, talking specifically about Grafana we can find seven main dashboards, which are:

- **MariaDB Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of MariaDB's performance and health. It tracks various metrics, helping users monitor database activity, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize overall efficiency.

- **Elasticsearch Dashboard:** Designed to give insights into Elasticsearch’s health, this dashboard presents a range of performance metrics. Users can easily track the system's efficiency and address potential issues.

- **Memcached Dashboard:** Focused on the health of the Memcached system, this dashboard offers a variety of performance metrics, enabling users to monitor and enhance caching effectiveness.

- **Hugging Face API Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a detailed view of the Hugging Face API's performance, including request count and maximum, minimum, and average embedding generation time.

- **S3 Crawler Dashboard:** This dashboard tracks the performance of the S3 Crawler, displaying metrics such as total processing time and objects processed. 

- **Backend API Dashboard:** This dashboard offers insights into the Backend API's performance, including cache hits, cache misses, maximum, minimum, and average request processing time, and total request count per endpoint.

- **Ingest Service Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a detailed view of the Ingest Service's performance, including object and row processing times, request counts, and error rates.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development aimed at validating individual components of the codebase in isolation. In this project, unit tests help ensure that key functions, classes, and modules behave as expected under different conditions. By detecting bugs early in the development cycle, unit testing minimizes the risk of defects making it to production, improves code quality, and enhances maintainability. Additionally, it allows for safer refactoring and easier integration of new features.

### Importance of Unit Testing
- Reliability: Unit tests verify that each module performs its intended function, building confidence that the system will operate as designed.
- Bug Detection: By isolating each part of the system, unit tests make it easier to catch bugs at an early stage, before they propagate through the codebase.
Refactoring Support: Well-written unit tests ensure that future changes or optimizations do not unintentionally break existing functionality.
- Documentation: Unit tests serve as a form of living documentation for the code, showing how various components are expected to behave.
- Efficiency in Development: Unit tests provide rapid feedback, allowing developers to fix issues before they escalate into larger, more complex problems.

### What modules should have unit testing
In this project, unit testing could be applying to key modules, including:

#### Hugging Face API
- Verifying the proper functioning of API requests and responses.
- Ensuring that the expected model outputs are returned based on the given input data.
- Testing the error handling for API call failures, timeouts, or invalid inputs.
- Ensuring metrics collection for Prometheus (e.g., API response times, successful requests).

#### Ingest
- Ensuring data ingestion pipelines correctly process various data formats and sizes.
- Testing individual data transformation functions for correctness.
- Validating error handling when ingestion fails (e.g., malformed data or network errors).

#### S3 crawler

- Testing the ability to list files from S3 buckets.
- Ensuring graceful handling of S3-specific errors.
- Testing the processing logic that acts upon the S3 data, ensuring it behaves correctly across different scenarios.

#### backend API
- Verifying the correctness of API endpoints (e.g., for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources).
- Ensuring the integration with external services, such as Elasticsearch for indexing, and MariaDB for data persistence.
- Testing error handling, such as database failures, message queue unavailability, or malformed requests.

### Why Unit Testing Was Not Implemented for Certain Modules
We decided not to implement unit testing for certain modules due to the complexity of their structure and their heavy reliance on external services. While unit testing is a critical part of maintaining code quality, there are several key reasons why these particular modules were not subjected to unit tests at this stage:

#### Complexity of the Modules
The modules in question, such as the Hugging Face API, the ingest, the S3 crawler, and the backend API, are highly intricate. They perform a series of complex operations that involve multiple steps of data processing, external API communication, and dynamic data transformations. Due to the depth and complexity of these operations, designing effective and meaningful unit tests would require an exhaustive setup and an in-depth understanding of the module internals, which often makes short, self-contained unit tests less feasible. For these modules, a full, dedicated testing strategy that goes beyond basic unit testing is required, including integration and system-level testing.

#### Dependency on External Services
Many of the core functions within these modules rely on interactions with external services such as Amazon S3, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, or Hugging Face APIs. Unit tests are generally meant to isolate the logic of the code from its environment, but the dependency on these services makes isolation challenging. Mocking these services for unit tests can introduce added complexity and would require comprehensive simulation of their behavior, which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world interactions. Given the tight coupling to these services, integration tests that work with real or closely simulated environments are a more practical approach to ensuring functionality.

#### Difficulty in Simplifying the Functions
The core logic in these modules is designed to handle intricate tasks such as multi-step data processing, cross-service communication, and API responses, which do not lend themselves easily to simplification for unit testing. Breaking these down into smaller, testable units would significantly alter the code's structure and could potentially affect its performance or readability. Moreover, writing unit tests for highly complex functions would likely result in fragile tests that are tightly coupled to implementation details, reducing the maintainability of the test suite.
